# Simple Questions on For Loop and While Loop in Python

## For Loop Questions:
1. Write a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
2. How do you iterate over each element in the list `colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']` using a `for` loop?
3. Write a `for` loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 5.
4. What will the following code output?
   ```python
   for i in range(4):
       print(i * 2)
   ```
5. Write a `for` loop to print all even numbers from 2 to 10.
6. Write a `for` loop to print the squares of numbers from 1 to 5.
7. Write a `for` loop that counts the number of vowels in the string `"hello world"`.


## While Loop Questions:
1. Write a `while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.
2. How do you create a loop that prints `"Hello, World!"` 3 times using a `while` loop?
3. Given the code below, what will it print?
   ```python
   x = 3
   while x > 0:
       print(x)
       x -= 1
   ```
4. Write a `while` loop to sum the numbers from 1 to 10.
5. How can you create an infinite loop using a `while` statement?
6. How do you use a `while` loop to keep asking the user for input until they enter the word `"exit"`?
7. Modify the following `while` loop to stop early when the value of `x` equals 5:
   ```python
   x = 0
   while x < 10:
       print(x)
       x += 1
   ```
8. How can you skip the current iteration in a `while` loop using a specific keyword?
