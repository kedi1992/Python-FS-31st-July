Introduction to Python


1. Setting Up the Environment:
	- Installing Python
	- Introduction to Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like PyCharm
	
	
2. Basic Concepts
	- What is Python?
	- First Python Program

3. Understanding Python's Internal Execution
	- Interpreted vs. Compiled Languages
	- Introduction to the Python interpreter
	- Execution Steps:
		Read Source Code
		Convert to Bytecode:
			- The Python code is compiled into an intermediate form called bytecode. 
			  Bytecode is a low-level set of instructions that is platform-independent. 
		Python Virtual Machine (PVM)
			- The compiled bytecode is executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). 
			- The PVM is a stack-based virtual machine that interprets the bytecode instructions
			- Loading Modules
			- Memory Management


Hands-On Practice
- PEP8 
- Simple exercises to practice variable assignments, basic operations, 
and string manipulations.
- Writing small programs, like a simple calculator or a program that takes 
user input and prints a formatted message.
