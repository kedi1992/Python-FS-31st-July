# Leap Year Conditions

A **leap year** is a year that has 366 days instead of the usual 365 days, with February having 29 days instead of 28.

## Conditions to Determine a Leap Year

To determine if a year is a leap year, follow these rules:

1. **Divisible by 4**: 
   - The year must be divisible by 4.

2. **Not Divisible by 100**:
   - If the year is divisible by 100, it **is not** a leap year, **unless**...

3. **Divisible by 400**:
   - The year is also divisible by 400, in which case it **is** a leap year.

### Summary

- A year divisible by 4 **and** not divisible by 100 **is** a leap year.
- A year divisible by 4 **and** divisible by 100 **must** also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.
